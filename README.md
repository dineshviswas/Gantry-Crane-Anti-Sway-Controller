This project focuses on controlling the trolley’s position and the payload’s angle of a gantry crane.
The system model is linearized, and the controller is designed using full-state feedback. 
Additionally, a compensator is implemented to improve steady-state performance. The system’s behaviour is animated to visualize the motion of the trolley and the payload.
The system is modelled, controlled, and animated in MATLAB.

The animated result can be found as gantry_crane_animation.mp4
